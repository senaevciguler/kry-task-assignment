# KRY code assignment

I've learned a lot in this assignment, especially because I don't have experience with reactive programming. I tried to learn the vertx and rxjava frameworks and the logic of how they work in doing this task.

- I tried to do DB operations with spring structure in the first step, just thought about calling vertx to check URLs. At the next step, I saw that this was illogical and thought about continuing with spring flux, so It became more complex than leave unfinished.


- In the second project, I tried to complete it by referencing sample projects and articles. I don't think it's very good in this example, but I could have digested these frameworks in more time and develop better examples. I'm sending it this way so that the delivery time can no longer pass.



It was a challenge that I loved and learned a lot about! I'm impatient to learn more about it and work together.
